## Code Libraries and Frameworks

Often, developers find that they have the same problems in many projects.

When it comes to CSS, several problems happen over and over again. For example:

- Consistency across browsers
- Making a responsive/mobile and desktop version
- Styling forms to look more modern and user friendly

Rather than each developer coding their solution and using it repeatedly, developers get together and make a code library or framework.

One popular CSS framework is called Bootstrap. It was initially developed at Twitter and was made open source in 2011. As an open-source project, anyone can use these code solutions for free, and they can also contribute to improving the project.

## Shifting Strategies

While a base understanding of CSS is critical in building websites, to get the most out of a code library/framework, more important is the ability to read the documentation and learn to use the built-in features.

[Bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) is quite good. As you look through it, you will see its many features. The more you build with it, the more you'll learn. Today we'll focus on getting set up and looking at some basic features.
